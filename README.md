## Getting Started

To get started with the Arduino Uno CH340 Diagnostic Tool, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Arduino IDE**: Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **CH340G Driver**: Ensure that you have the CH340G driver installed for your operating system. This driver is crucial for your computer to communicate with CH340G-based Arduino boards.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Simpact-Online-Services/arduino-uno-ch340-diagnostic-tool.git
   ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Navigate to `File` > `Open...` and select the `arduino-uno-ch340-diagnostic-tool` folder.
4. Open the `.ino` file within the folder.
5. Connect your CH340G-based Arduino Uno to your computer.

### Running the Diagnostic Tool

1. Upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno by clicking the upload button in the Arduino IDE.
2. Open the Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE (`Tools` > `Serial Monitor`).
3. Set the baud rate to 9600.
4. Follow the instructions displayed in the Serial Monitor.

### Download the Latest Release

To download the latest release of the diagnostic tool, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Simpact-Online-Services/arduino-uno-ch340-diagnostic-tool/releases). Download the appropriate file, and execute it according to the instructions provided.

## Usage

Once the sketch is uploaded and the Serial Monitor is open, you will see various prompts that will guide you through the diagnostic process. Follow these steps:

1. **Bootloader Check**: The tool will send a command to check if the bootloader is functioning. If it responds positively, your bootloader is working.
2. **Reset Check**: The tool will test the reset functionality. You should see a message confirming whether the reset is successful.
3. **Serial Communication**: Finally, the tool will test serial communication. It will display messages that confirm the status of the serial connection.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the diagnostic tool, consider the following:

- Ensure that your Arduino board is properly connected to your computer.
- Check if the correct COM port is selected in the Arduino IDE.
- Make sure the CH340G driver is correctly installed.
- Restart the Arduino IDE if you face any unexpected behavior.
